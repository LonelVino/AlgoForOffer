    "**Relationship with bucket sort**:  Bucket sort may be used in lieu of counting sort, and entails a similar time analysis. <br/>\n",

    " **Usage Scenario**:\n",
    " -  Its running time is linear in the number of items and the difference between the maximum key value and the minimum key value, so it is only suitable for direct use in situations where the **variation in keys is not significantly greater than the number of items**. \n",
