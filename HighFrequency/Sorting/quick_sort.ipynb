    "Divide and conquer: filter the original array into 2 sub-arrays, in which the data of the first array should be smaller than the data of the latter one, and then recursively sort the 2 sub-arrays. Specifically: \n",
    "1. <font color=orange>**normally, the start/end element should be chosen as the base**</font>, which should be kept still and will only be exchanged until 2 sentries meet each other.\n",
    "   1. set 2 sentries(pointers) at the start and at the end, denoted as $p_s$ and $p_e$, respectively; \n",
    "      - $p_s$ goes from left to right, aiming to find an element $x_l$ larger than the base;\n",
    "      - $p_e$ goes from right to left, aiming to find an element $x_s$ smaller than the base;\n",
    "   2. exchange $x_s$ and $x_l$;\n",
    "   3. continue to move these 2 sentries, repeat the process above;\n",
    "2. until $p_s$ and $p_e$ meet each other, exchange $x_b$ and $arr[p_s]$ (*i.e.*, $arr[p_e]$).  \n",
    "3. recursively call the function to quick sort the 2 sub-array, and at last we will get a entirely ordered array.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 1. <font color=yellow>**When the very <u>left</u> one is chosen as the base `p_b = arr[l]`, the <u>rightmost</u> sentry should move first**, *i.e.*, \n",
    "> ```\n",
    ">  while ..... : p_e -= 1;\n",
    ">  while ..... : p_s += 1;\n",
    "> ``` \n",
    ">  2. **On the contrary, when the very <u>right</u> one is chosen as the base `p_b = arr[r]`, the <u>leftmost</u> sentry should move first.**\n",
    "> \n",
    "> The reason is that, consider the condition in which the leftmost one is chosen as the base `p_b = arr[l]`, if the leftmost sentry `p_s` moves first, it might stop at the element **larger** than the base when encountering the rightmost sentry `p_e`, then after the switch between the base `arr[p_b]`(left) and `arr[p_s]`(right), the order will be incorrect.</font>\n",
    "> \n",
    "> ps: it should be easy to deduce that **the base shouldn't appear in the middle of the array**"
